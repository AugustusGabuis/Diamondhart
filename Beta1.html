    <p> Description: </p>
    <image src="Beta1.png" />  
  <p> Beta1 is a building, inside the building is a satanic star, at the center of the star is a piece of wood with candles and an animal skull on it. </p>
    <p> When the candles are lit, a small earthquake will happen within 300 feet, the earthquake has been classified as 3.4 on the Richter Scale. </p>
    <p> During the 3.4 Scale earthquake, a portal will begin to open on the ground, Lucas Bjorn and Dianna Gialen have thought this portal was to Hell.  </p>
    <p> They thought that because all you can see is a deep red, similar to the cultist circle.</p>
    <p> Inside the portal is a large cavern, humanoid beings can be seen, Hereby known as Beta1-A. Beta1-A instances usually have red skin and wings</p>
    <p> It is unknown if Beta1-A is hostile, Beta1-A could potentially even be sentient, if so, there is a whole other civilization under that portal.</p>
    <p> If there is, it is neccisary that we contact this civilization. </p>
    
    <p> Benefits: </p>
    <p> It's literally hell, the benefits of having a portal to hell are endless. </p>
    <p> If we ally the potential civilization, we can get more military. </p>
    <p> We could also mine the minerals of Hell.</p>
