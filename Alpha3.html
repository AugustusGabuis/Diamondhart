  <p> Description: </p>
  <p> Alpha3 is a barrel drum that is always on fire. </p>
  <p> Alpha3's fire can melt through anything. </p>
  <p> Wood melts in only 5 seconds. </p>
  <p> Metal melts in only 2 minutes. </p>
  <p> Due to metal being so easily melted, We believe that anything can be melted using Alpha3.</p>
  <p> In theory, using an element that has a reaction to heat could cause some dangerous reactions.</p>

  <p> Easy disposal of corpses and other things </p>
  <p> Potential way to destroy other anomalies </p>
