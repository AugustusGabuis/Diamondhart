    <p> Description: </p>
    <p> Alpha1 is a seemingly normal arcade machine, until you play it, when you play Alpha1, you get teleported into Alpha1-P, a pocket dimension. </p>
    <p> There are three rooms in Alpha1-P, The room you teleport into is a white room, with a door you can get through thats also white. </p>
    <p> Next is a hallway, where there are two doors, one leads to what looks like a room to watch the first room. </p>
    <p> Finally, the other door lets you leave Alpha1-P and return to where the arcade machine is. </p>
    <p> Alpha1 has some interesting properties, the first being it's regeneration. When Alpha1-P is damaged, slowly the damage will regenerate. </p>
    <p> It is unknown what happens when someone is inside while it gets damaged. </p>
    <p> When Alpha1 gets unplugged, the people in Alpha1-P begin seeing creatures in Alpha1-P, aswell as they begin getting intense migranes. </p>
    <p> Benefits: </p>
    <p> Excellent torture method, as it is unknown if the person actually can die inside of Alpha1-P. </p>
    <p> Excellent storage facility, as objects don't get damaged. </p>
