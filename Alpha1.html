    <p> Next is a hallway, where there are two doors, one leads to what looks like a room to watch the first room. </p>
    <p> Finally, the other door lets you leave Alpha1-P and return to where the arcade machine is. </p>
    <p> Alpha1 has some interesting properties, the first being it's regeneration. When Alpha1-A is damaged, slowly the damage will regenerate. </p>
    <p> It is unknown what happens when someone is inside while it gets damaged. </p>
    <p> When Alpha1 gets unplugged, the people in Alpha1-A begin seeing creatures in Alpha1-A, aswell as they begin getting intense migranes. </p>
      <p> After 5 minutes in Alpha1-A, the walls of Alpha1-A will collaspe, and the person inside will find themselves in a black void.</p>
      <p> After 10 minutes, any creatures will turn hostile, trying to kill the subject. </p>
      <p> Usually, the creatures will manage to kill the subject, but if the subject takes any illegal substance, it'll become as if they just got into Alpha1.</p>
      <p> After, The subject will see these creatures for presumably ever. </p>
      <p> The creatures in Alpha1-A (Creatures are Alpha1-B) have 2 states, passive state is where Alpha1-B isn't solid and is passive. </p>
      <p> The hostile state of Alpha1-B is solid, and well hostile. </p>
