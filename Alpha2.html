  <p> Descriptions: </p>
    <p> Alpha2 is a saucer-shapped building, nothing more could be known until the National Guard allowed Diamondhart to study it.</p>
    <p> Alpha2's inside is split into 3 rings, the first ring has a lot of lights, it is unknown what these lights do, it could be core parts </p>
    <p> Alpha2's inner most rings have human chambers, some with humans, most without, they are probably dead. </p>
    <p> Alpha2's inner most ring has a core, and when things enter the core, they begin to defy gravity </p>
    
    <p> Benefits: </p>
  <p> Imprisonment </p>
  <p> Research on how no gravity effects other things </p>
