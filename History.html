  <p> Welcome to the Diamondhart Hub. </p>
  <p> For all of history, there have been things have are not normal, things that are logically impossible, things that could end the world if they go unnoticed. </p>
  <p> It is Diamondhart's mission to contain these anomalies. </p>
  <p> Ronni Davi was born in 1974, and he found one of these anomalies, He found Alpha1. </p>
  <p> Ronni Davi is responsible for building the foundations of Diamondhart, he made the company, got soldiers, got scientists, and got spies.</p>
  <p> Ronni Davi got shot, and a new CEO emerged, Matthew Bjorn. Matthew Bjorn sent 2 hazmats to town, 01 and 02. </p>
  <p> 01 and 02 were very incompetant, and they killed a police officer, Michael Peterson. </p>
  <p> 02 died from gunshot, it is unknown who murdered him, but some people believe it was Dianna Gialen.</p>
  <p> 01 committed suicide after 02's death.</p>
  <p> After that, Lucas Bjorn spoke to Dianna Gialen, Mr. Bjorn hasn't said any specifics, but after Mr. Bjorn convinced shareholders to make Mr. Bjorn C.E.O.</p>
  <p> Under Mr. Bjorn's Ownership, Diamondhart has grown signifigantly, it now contains 8 anomalies.</p>
